# COP Network Web App

This application is built using Plotly graphs and the Dash web
framework to build a simple, reactive UI to explore the University
of Kentucky College of Pharmacy's Google Scholar network.

## Procedure for adding to the network:

Currently, if you wish to add either yourself or a colleague to the network you can provide us with their names and/or (preferably) their Google Scholar IDs and we can add them into the network. We are looking into turning this into a feature of the website that users could do independently (see below). Contact: nan231@uky.edu.

## Features:

- Dynamic dropdowns of authors
- Comprehensive graph of entire COP scholar network
- Dynamic network creation based on selected authors

## Future plans:

- Color code selected author nodes inside network visualization
  for easy identification
- Add more authors to the network
- Ability to add new authors to network directly from the site
